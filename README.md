## Dataset 1: Astronomical Data (Kaggle)

In this project, I explored an astronomical dataset, utilizing **Pandas** for data manipulation and employing various data visualization techniques to uncover insights. Key tasks and techniques include:

- Loading and manipulating tabular data using **Pandas**
- Visualizing data using different types of plots:
  - Bar Graphs
  - Box Plots
  - Line Plots
  - Pair Plots
  - Scatter Plots
- Saving visualizations and analysis results with `matplotlib.pyplot.savefig()`

Libraries utilized: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Dataset 2: Market Dataset (Kaggle)

This project focused on applying **linear regression** to a market dataset. Key aspects of this project include:

- Analyzing **correlations** between variables and understanding their relationships
- Developing and implementing a **linear regression model**
- Evaluating the model's performance using:
  - `sklearn.linear_model`
  - `train_test_split`
  - `mean_squared_error`
